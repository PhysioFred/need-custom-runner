A Cloud Guru Setting Up a Custom GitHub Actions Runner due to compliance

You are setting up a new app’s CI/CD process. Due to compliance requirements, this team’s code needs to run on your organization’s infrastructure, not GitHub’s. You will be provided with an EC2 instance, which you will need to set up to work as a GitHub runner. You will then need to set up a workflow to run only on that runner. Finally, you will need to disconnect the runner from your repo for the end of the lab.
